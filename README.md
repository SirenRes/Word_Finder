It is totally OOP-based without using the built-in method of any data type.It's just pure algorithm, in addition to it's optimized to eliminate clone words. The reason I created this was to challenge myself under the roof of OOP.

Notes:

1-) If it is desired to be improved, it can be simply replaced with a word list. (.txt, .docx etc.)

Usage:

Modify the only variable in the start.py file as specified there.
